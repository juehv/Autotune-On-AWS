<p>
    The temporary basal records in Nightscout typically include either an "absolute" or "percent" setting to show in
    Nightscout how much insulin has been delivered during that time. However, Autotune expects a different setting called
    "rate". If this setting is missing from your temporary basal records then Autotune will not have a full picture of
    how much insulin has been delivered and therefore the results of Autotune should not be used.
</p>

<p>
    Temporary basal records generated by OpenAPS and AndroidAPS starting from version 2.0 RC 6.1 generate the "rate" setting
    and are therefore compatible with Autotune. Earlier versions of AndroidAPS do not include this setting and therefore
    cannot be used with Autotune.
